# SonoMetric

**Medical-Grade Pulsed Doppler Ultrasound Simulation**

SonoMetric is a high-fidelity PyQt5 application designed to simulate Pulsed Wave (PW) Doppler ultrasound signal acquisition and processing. It features a professional "Medical Dark" user interface, real-time spectral analysis, and custom-built physics simulation engines.

## Features

- **Medical Grade UI**: Deep dark theme (`#121212`) with "Medical Cyan" accents, designed for radiology environments.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Multithreaded physics engine simulating scatterer movement and RF signal backscattering.
- **Spectral Analysis**: Custom signal processing pipeline (STFT) displayed as a dynamic spectrogram.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Segmented Angle Control (30°, 60°, 75°).
  - Status Indication System.
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Real-time velocity estimation and error tracking.
